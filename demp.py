# Write a program that accepts the weight of a package in grams and then converts it to kilograms and also specifies
# how many such packages form one kilogram. For example, if the user enters the weight (in grams) of the package as 100,
# the output should be;
# The weight of the package is 0.1 kilograms.
# It takes 10 such packages to form one kilogram.
